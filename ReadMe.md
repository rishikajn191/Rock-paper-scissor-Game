<h1>Rock Paper Scissor</h1>
A Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a simple, hand-gesture-based game typically played between two players.
<h3>Game Rules:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Rock crushes Scissors.</li>
  <li>Scissors cuts Paper.</li>
  <li>Paper covers Rock.</li>
</ul>
<br>Each player secretly selects one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). They then reveal their choices at the same time, and the winner is determined according to the rules above. If both players select the same option, the result is a tie.
